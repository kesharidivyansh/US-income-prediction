## Project Overview
In this project, we explore supervised machine learning models for regression to predict the average household income. The goal is to develop accurate predictive models that can provide insights into factors influencing household income.

The key highlights of this project include:
- Utilizing a dataset with 396,030 rows and 37 columns.
- Employing bagging and boosting algorithms to build robust regression models.
- Gaining valuable insights and experience in the field of supervised machine learning models.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is not included in this repository due to its size, but it can be obtained from [provide_dataset_source_link]. The dataset contains a wealth of information about households, including demographic data, economic indicators, and other relevant features.

## Algorithms Used
We used the following machine learning algorithms for regression:
- Bagging Algorithms (e.g., Random Forest, Decision Tree)
- Boosting Algorithms (e.g., XGBoost)
- Linear Regression Model
These algorithms were chosen for their effectiveness in handling complex regression problems and their ability to capture intricate relationships within the data.

- XGBoost provided the best results for the model.
